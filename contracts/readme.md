# InternshipToken Project

## Vision
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1e0870b-3846-4f01-b35a-874908508319)


The **InternshipToken** project aims to streamline the management and reward of internships by leveraging blockchain technology. By tokenizing internships, we provide a transparent, secure, and efficient method for tracking milestones and distributing rewards. This innovation simplifies administrative tasks, enhances accountability, and provides interns with a reliable way to receive compensation.

## Flowchart

The following flowchart illustrates the workflow of the `InternshipToken` system:
